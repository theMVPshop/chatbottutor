### Node/NPM Recap

Today we'll recap Node.js and NPM. The goal of this assignment is to complete a set of functions so that all of the tests pass. Additionally, one set of functions will use a popular NPM package, moment.js, to help us format dates and times.

 - [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [Node Practice](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS311-node-practice).
- [ ] Follow the `README` to complete the functions and make all the tests pass.

Today we are going to set up our own database instance (which can hold many databases) on Google Cloud. We will continue to use this instance throughout the rest of this course. Once it's set up we will create a database and then import some data into a table called "users". We will then practice querying that data with SELECT statements. We will download a tool called [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to help us do this.

### Part One: Account, Database, & Connect

#### Google Cloud

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is one of the most popular and robust platforms for maintaining infrastructure (servers) in the cloud. It has an intuitive user interface and support for many open source projects including MySQL. It continues to gain ground on AWS as the de-facto IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service) platform, but developers certainly have their options. Other cloud platforms include AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, etc.

#### Pricing

Google Cloud has a free option for developers getting started with the platform. Upon registration, each account receives $300 in credit to use on computing resources as you learn. A credit card is required for registration but you will **not** be auto-renewed, bumped into a paid version or charged at all without your permission. See below:

#### Creating Your Account

- [ ] Navigate to: [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [ ] Click "Get started for free" in the top right corner
- [ ] Complete the steps to create account
    * [ ] **Credit card required here**
    * [ ] *Credit card will not be charged*
- [ ] Upon successful registration you should see the main dashboard

#### Creating DB Instance

- [ ] Take a look at the navigation menu (top-left) on the dashboard. You should see a lot of options.
- [ ] Locate the heading that reads "STORAGE" and click the "SQL" option.
- [ ] Click "CREATE INSTANCE" near the top of the page.
- [ ] Select "MySQL" from the two options.
- [ ] Fill out the form with the following information
    * [ ] Instance ID: "first-instance"
    * [ ] Root password: a password of your choice
    * [ ] All other defaults can be left alone
- [ ] Click "Create" and wait for the instance to be set up. This can take a few minutes.
- [ ] When the instance is ready there will be a green checkmark next to it. Click on the name "first-instance" to see an overview.
- [ ] In this overview screen, look for a menu option called "DATABASES" and click it.
- [ ] Create a database called "admin".

We're almost done . . . we just need to allow the database instance to be accessed from outside of this console. To do that we need to whitelist our IP address.

- [ ] Navigate to the "CONNECTIONS" tab.
- [ ] Look for the checkbox by "Public IP", we need to add a network.
- [ ] Find your [IP address here](https://www.google.com/search?ei=Ds7_XODXFOOwtgW2o5OABA&q=what%27s+my+ip) and enter it into the dialog box with a name.
    * [ ] Note that you will need to do this for each network you want to access the database from (home, work, ACA, Starbucks, wherever . . .)
- [ ] Make sure to click the save button.
We're ready to go! We have a database set up in Google Cloud that can be accessed from anywhere. Now we need to learn how to interact with it in the next step.

#### Download MySQL Workbench

- [ ] Navigate to [MySQL Workbench download](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
- [ ] Click "Download Now"
- [ ] At the bottom of the page select your system specs (Mac, Windows)
- [ ] Click the "download" button again and then click "No thanks, just start my download" on the next page
- [ ] When the download completes, install MySQL Workbench
- [ ] Start MySQL Workbench.

=== "For Windows Users"

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12j-tiRpXX4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

=== "For Older Mac Users"

    * download an early version of the workbench: 
        - [https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/workbench/](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/workbench/)
    * and/or use this guide: 
        - [https://www.macminivault.com/install-mysql-on-macos-high-sierra/](https://www.macminivault.com/install-mysql-on-macos-high-sierra/)

#### Connect MySQL Workbench to the Database on GCP

- [ ] When opening MySQL Workbench, one of the first things you see is some text that says "MySQL Connections"
- [ ] Click the little plus sign next to that text. A dialog box should pop up
- [ ] Fill out the following information:
    * [ ] Connection Name: "first-instance"
    * [ ] Hostname: The IP address of your db in GCP
    * [ ] You can find this on the "OVERVIEW" tab
    * [ ] Password: Click "store in keychain" and enter the password you gave your instance when you set it up in the last step
    * [ ] Default Schema: We'll use the name of the database we created earlier, "admin"
- [ ] Click "Test Connection". It should have been successful
- [ ] Click "Ok" to save the connection
The new connection should be listed under "MySQL Connections", double click it to connect to the database

<!-- Just added aug16th -->
##NOTE:
When creating your first-instance you are using sensitive variables given to you by google to connect to the database you created. When we connect to our local server were going to use a file called `.env'. More on this soon. Just be aware the variables you use are secret.

We should have successfully created a database and connected to it. We've done a lot of setup so far but for our homework we'll add some data to our database and begin querying the data. Reference the following docs for additional information and walkthroughs of what we've covered so far.

Today we are going to do some advanced querying of our database. We are going to reconstruct our tables so that the "users" information is split into three tables and we will practice `JOIN`ing and `GROUP`ing data to fit our needs.

So far we've covered the `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` and `JOIN` command keywords, and most recently we've added `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to our repertoire. Be sure to reference the lecture and the docs provided to complete today's project.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [Advanced Select](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk3_day2_advanced_select)
- [ ] Follow the `README.md` to join tables, group by and generate an ER (Entity Relationship) diagram.

### Push Yourself Further

Follow the steps below to create an ER (Entity Relationship) diagram for your homework project. Assuming the homework was complete, you should have three tables: users, usersContact and usersAddress.

- [ ] Open MySQL Workbench.
- [ ] Ensure you are connected to your database.
- [ ] Test a query by running `SELECT * FROM users;`.
- [ ] In the MySQL Workbench menu, select Database -> Reverse Engineer.
- [ ] A dialog box should have appeared.
- [ ] In the first dropdown (stored connection), select the connection to your instance.
- [ ] Click "continue" three times until a list of databases appears. There should only be one ("admin").
- [ ] Select the "admin" database and continue accepting all other defaults.
- [ ] You should see your ER diagram displayed.
- [ ] Hover over the tables to see the relationships (usersContact and usersAddress point back to users).
- [ ] Click around the diagram and discover other information about your tables.

## Checkpoint 1: Express CRUD Server

So far we've recapped node/NPM, learned protocols, Axios, Express, routes and controllers, static files, status codes and had an intro to MySQL. We will use most of these technologies for this assignment.

* Express
* bodyParser
* Routes
* Controllers
* Use of static data (provided)
* GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
* Appropriate status codes

    > We will NOT be utilizing static files or MySQL.

### Checkpoint Objective

We are going to build an Express CRUD app using the knowledge we have of Express so far.

### Instructions

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [Checkpoint 1](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_checkpoint_1)
- [ ] Follow the README to create an Express CRUD app

Today we are going to work on the CRUD operations of our database. We will practice `INSERT`ing, `UPDATE`ing and `DELETE`ing records from our tables and use our existing knowledge of `SELECT` to help us verify the changes we made. After this lesson we should have everything we need to interact with SQL databases.

![class-seven-sql-crud-delete-example](./../images/class-seven-sql-crud-delete-example.png)
![class-seven-sql-crud-delete-preferences](./../images/class-seven-sql-crud-delete-preferences.png)

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [SQL CRUD](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk4_day1_crud)
- [ ] Follow the `README.md` to `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` records.
- [ ] [YT, the Bad Tutorials - SQL Tutorial 25: ORDER BY](https://youtu.be/6YGvqrwQ9d4)

    > NOTE: As mentioned before, we will often want to check to make sure the inserts, updates or deletes worked as expected, and we do that by running a `SELECT` query on the data to view it.
    > NOTE 2: One important clause that we haven't talked about yet is the `ORDER BY` [clause](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_orderby.asp). It will help you order the data in your tables by a field or group of fields. For example, if you just inserted a record, you may want to perform a `SELECT` statement in descending "order by" `id` so that the newest record is at the top. The video above will explain this clause.

### Push Yourself Further

The following document covers `INSERT`s, `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s as well as commands to create and drop tables and databases. Additionally, the `DISTINCT` [command](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp) will give you an easy way to de-dupe result sets.

- [ ] Review the following document on [most popular sql commands](https://www.webhostface.com/blog/most-popular-mysql-commands/)
- [ ] Continue using the [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) to further your learning. You will need to continuously reference docs like this in order to know how to write your SQL statements. Additionally, Google searches like "MySQL find all records that start with A" can be helpful in pointing you to Stack Overflow articles on the appropriate topic. The key is knowing what to search for. Often it's easier than you think.

Today we are going to work on the CRUD operations of our database again but this time all the operations will be in an Express app. After today we will have a fully functioning API attached to an SQL database. We still have a few more things to do in this course but at this point you should be proud because we've gotten through the meat of it! More best practices such as authentication to come . . .

In the example below we see how to parse this immense data into just what we need, dynamically.

There are a couple semi-advanced concepts in SQL that we haven't covered yet, but that's ok. The bulk of our time has been prioritizing the necessities. That being said, if you really want to take it to the next level (AND YOU SHOULD) you can spend some time on your own learning about `transactions` and `stored procedures`.

Today we will create Trello accounts (if you haven't already done so) and gain access to the ACA_311_HACKATHON Trello board.

### Creating a Trello Account

Create a Trello account by navigating to [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US) and clicking the "Sign Up" button on the top right. Sign up with either traditional or Google authentication. **Use the same email as the one you signed up with Zollege & Canvas!**

Paste the email you used to sign up for Trello in the class RocketChat so that the instructor can "invite" you to the board ([ACA_Hackathon](https://trello.com/b/wUbVNAWo/aca311hackathon)). The RocketChat message should look like this:

`Trello access - <EMAIL ADDRESS>`

Start looking at the tasks on the list and deciding who will do what. You can be assigning yourself to the tickets that you think you can handle. Each person should have an even amount of tickets (or close). You should also get a feel for which order you believe the tasks need to happen in. Obviously choose the first tasks first. For example, you must set up Express before you can begin building routes or integrating MySQL. Don't worry, the instructor will act as an over-arching project manager for this assignment.

### Project Instructions

We will use the following repo for both days this week. We will start work on the API today and finish next class. The API Hackathon is intended to re-enforce concepts and make you very comfortable creating these in the future. Your role as a full-stack or back-end developer will depend partially on this skill set.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [API HACKATHON](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk5_both_api_hackathon)
- [ ] Follow the `README` and Trello board to create a Node/Express API with MySQL from scratch.

## Checkpoint Two - Data Model for your Capstone App

Throughout this course and the next you will begin giving consideration to (and building) your final/Capstone App. The data need for this app will be the focus of this Checkpoint 2.

You are going to lay out the data model that you'll use in our final project/Capstone App. You might be creating an ecommerce project, or a weather app, or perhaps you don't even know what you want to create. This is the time to figure it out. (*Hopefully not because you've been doing presentations over the app*) To complete this Checkpoint you'll need to plan the API for the app and build the data model.

### Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Repo named after your Capstone App's title.
- [ ] List of Data Needs in `README.md`.
- [ ] Tables, Fields, and Relationships listed in `README.md`.
- [ ] Copy of ER diagrams saved in Repo.
- [ ] Steps to create DB on GCP Instance, How to connect to it with Workbench, and how to seed it with data written in `README.md`.
- [ ] Files with SQL commands to initialize the data.

### Instructions

- [ ] Decide what the focus of your final project will be. Write it down.
- [ ] Create a name for this app/project.
- [ ] Create new repo titled the name of your app with a `README.md` file.
- [ ] In the `README.md`, list out the data you think you'll need for this app.
    * [ ] Categorize the data into tables
    * [ ] Define relationships between those tables
- [ ] Using any digital tool you like, construct an ER diagram that communicates those tables, their relationships and their fields/properties.
- [ ] Save a copy of this ER Diagram in the repo.
- [ ] Review the steps to create a DB, connect to it, seed it with data and write them down in the `README.md`.
- [ ] Write the SQL Commands that would create the tables in files named after the data like: `userSeedData.sql`, `carSeedData.sql`, `productSeedData.sql`, etc...
- [ ] Store those files in the repo
- [ ] Upload the repo's link to the Checkpoint-2 Assignment

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

We will follow the instructions below to create a new project with create-react-app and host the project in Cloud Storage. Additional documentation is provided below.

- [ ] [GCP Docs - Creating a bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#create-bucket)
- [ ] [GCP Docs - Uploading files](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#uploading_your_sites_files)
- [ ] [GCP Docs - Hosting static sites](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website)

![gcp-bucket-details-page](./../images/gcp-bucket-details-page.png)

1. **(If Necessary) Install create-react-app**: `npm i -g create-react-app`

2. **Create the App with React**
    * [ ] Create a new project with your last name and the word "app" (ex. smith-app)
        * [ ] in the appropriate folder, i.e. `jsdev`, run `create-react-app smith-app`
    * [ ] `cd smith-app`
    * [ ] Use `npm start` to verify the project is working as expected

3. **Create a production build version**
    * [ ] Inside of your project, add the following to your `package.json` file: `"homepage": "./"`
    
    > You can do this right after the closing curly brace for `"browserslist"`. Make sure you add a comma after the curly-brace and before your `"homepage"` property.

    ```json
        <!-- more code here -->
            },

            "browserslist": {

                "production": [

                    ">0.2%",

                    "not dead",

                    "not op_mini all"

                ],

                "development": [

                    "last 1 chrome version",

                    "last 1 firefox version",

                    "last 1 safari version"

                ]

            },

            "homepage": "./"

        }
    ```

    > We are doing this because create-react-app made some assumptions about where you are serving the app from. We don't need to worry about this here.

    - [ ] Go to `./public/robots.txt` and update the text to say:

        ```markdown

            # https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html

            User-agent: *

            Allow: /
        ```
        
    - [ ] Run `npm run build` to create the files we need for production. They will live under the "build" folder.

4. **Creating a bucket**

    - [ ] Open your Google Cloud console in your browser
    - [ ] Under the main Google Cloud navigation select "Storage" under the heading "Storage" (redundant)
    - [ ] Click "Create Bucket"
    - [ ] Give your bucket a name. Keep in mind that this name must be unique across ALL of Cloud Storage so that means if anyone else has chosen your name first, you're out of luck. For our purposes let's try to call it the same thing as our create-react-app,  so -app (ex. "smith-app"). If this is taken, add some random numbers/letters.
    - [ ] Leave all other default options

5. **Uploading files**

    There are multiple ways to upload files to Cloud Storage. The two main ways are through the console with the "upload" button or with `gsutil`. Gsutils was downloaded when we downloaded the gcloud command-line utilities. Since we have already used the command line tools we are going to continue with that.

    - [ ] Use the `gsutil` tool to upload all files in the "build" folder to your bucket

        * [ ] If you are in the root project folder the command is: `gsutil cp -R build/* gs://smith-app`
        
        > NOTE: "-R" means recursively copy all items and "smith" is a sample last name

    - [ ] You should see progress happening in your terminal and a "completed" message when it is done
    - [ ] Refresh the page in the Google Cloud console to see your files in the bucket

6. **Bucket Permissions**

    In order to let people view our site we need to update our permissions and make the bucket public.

    In the console, select the "permissions" tab on your - [ ] bucket
    - [ ] Click "add members". You should see a side-panel open
    - [ ] Start typing "allUsers". You should see an option for this in the dropdown
    - [ ] Under "select a role" navigate down to storage and click "Storage Object Viewer"
    - [ ] Click "Save".
    - [ ] Repeat this process but this time choose the "Storage Legacy Bucket Reader" role.
    - [ ] Click "Save" Your bucket now has public permissions.

7. **View the site**

    You can view your app at: `https://storage.googleapis.com/<BUCKET NAME>/index.html`

    If all went according to plan we now have the basic `create-react-app` running in the cloud.

    > A quick note about this setup . . . this is not actually configured to serve traffic just yet. Notice how we had to navigate to the "index.html" file? Our users shouldn't have to do that. We just want to note that in order to set your site up to avoid that we need to edit the website configuration and you can only do that if you have a custom domain as described here. Domains are typically pretty cheap. We'd encourage you to buy a cheap domain from [https://domains.google.com/registrar](https://domains.google.com/registrar) and create another bucket with your domain name (www.example.com) in order to truly have a site running in GCS (Google Cloud Storage).

8. **Follow-Up Video**

    - [ ] [YT, StuffedBox - Host a Static Website on GCP](https://youtu.be/Jw60rw4p2lk)
 
### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Purchase a domain name from [domains.google.com](https://domains.google.com/registrar) (or any other web hosting provider)
- [ ] Create a bucket with the name of that domain (www.example.com)
- [ ] Upload a basic create-react-app site
- [ ] Edit permissions to make the bucket public
- [ ] "Edit website configuration" to set the main (index) page and the 404 page
- [ ] Add a CNAME to your DNS configuration (godaddy) to point to the GCS
    * [ ] [Creating a CNAME](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#cname)
- [ ] View your live website

Today we are going to learn how to configure a CI/CD pipeline using CloudBees CodeShip. This will enable us to automatically deploy our updates to the cloud when we commit our changes on the master branch.

To start, please sign up for a [free CloudBees CodeShip account](https://codeship.com/). You can tie your login to your GitHub account (recommended).

![codeship-deployment-log](./../images/codeship-deployment-log.png)

### Project Instructions

We will be using our previously deployed repository, [311_wk7_day1_deployment](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk7_day1_deployment), for this project.

1. **CloudBees CodeShip Setup**

    - [ ] Log in to your CloudBees CodeShip account
    - [ ] In the top-nav, select *"Projects"*
    - [ ] Select *"New Project"*
    - [ ] Under *"Select Your SCM"* choose sGitHub
    - [ ] Find the repository for your deployed application from two classes ago.
        *  [ ] This should be [311_wk7_day1_deployment](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk7_day1_deployment)
    - [ ] Choose *"connect"*.
    - [ ] Choose *"Codeship Basic"*.
    - [ ] You should see a page that says *"Setup Commands"*. In the code area.. type `npm install` on the first line.
        
        > Every time we make a change to our code, CloudBees CodeShip will re-install the dependencies. Remember that we do not commit node_modules to GitHub so the deployment tool will need to generate them

    - [ ] Click *"save changes"*.
    - [ ] On the top-left, navigate to the *"Deploy"* section.
    - [ ] Leave the *"branch type"* alone and type `master`/`main` in the second input.
        *  [ ] `branch type is exactly master`/`branch type is exactly main`. This means the deployment will only happen on changes to the `master`/`main` branch
    - [ ] Click *"save pipeline settings"*.
    
    > You should be on a page with different deployments listed and a header that says *"Add Deployment"*.

    - [ ] You should also see *"App Engine"* as an option. Choose it.
    
    > CloudBees CodeShip will need some information from us regarding our Google Cloud account:

    - [ ] `Project ID` - navigate to the homepage in Google Cloud and see the card called "Project info". Your project id can be found underneath
    - [ ] `Key file` - scroll down the page to see the section called *"Creating a Service Key"*, use those instructions to generate your key.
    - [ ] Upload the generated key.
    - [ ] `URL` - leave blank
    - [ ] `Folder` - leave blank
    - [ ] Click *"create deployment"* at the bottom of the page.

2. **Enable Admin API**

    In order for CloudBees CodeShip to talk with our Google Cloud account we need to do one more thing . . . enable the API.

    In your Google Cloud dashboard,

    - [ ] search for "App Engine Admin API" and click "enable".

3. **Testing our deployment**

    - [ ] Navigate to the CloudBees CodeShip dashboard by clicking the boat in the upper left-hand corner.
    - [ ] In your repository, edit the default route in the `index.js` file. Change it from `"welcome to our server"` to `"welcome to our updated server"`.
    - [ ] Save the changes, `commit` them and `push` them to GitHub
    - [ ] If you refresh the CloudBees CodeShip page you should see a build in progress. Click on it to follow the **logs**.
    - [ ] You should see a set of numeric steps taking place to deploy your changes.
    - [ ] Wait for all the steps to complete and then navigate to the "App Engine" page in Google Cloud.
    - [ ] Click the link in the top-right that looks like `https://new-project-385736.appspot.com/` and you should see the text `"welcome to our updated server"`.
    - [ ] Additionally, on that dashboard there should be small text underneath the graph that says *"debug || source"*. Choose *"source"*.
    - [ ] Click on the `"index.js"` file and you should see your updated source code in production.
    - [ ] Your app is now deployed!

4. **Creating a Service Key - Google Cloud**

    In your App Engine Dashboard:

    - [ ] In the left navigation menu, select *"IAM & admin"*
    - [ ] Click *"service accounts"* on the left-hand side. You should see one account
    - [ ] Under the *"actions"* label, select the triple dot menu and choose *"Create Key"*
    - [ ] Make sure *JSON* is selected and click *"create"*
    - [ ] A key should have been saved to your computer

### Push Yourself Further

For the remainder of the class we will continue building your graduation app.

After completing your homework from last night you should be able to now complete your SQL database.

Remember, the goal here is to leave this class with a full database and server deployed and ready to be consumed by your React app in the next class, JS411.

## Push Yourself Further

If you've built your SQL database and connected it to your Express server then add a layer of authentication so your app can be deployed soon.

> IMPORTANT: In your next class we will focus on the frontend using React. We'll no longer be working on SQL and Express but it's important that you retain these skills, work on your backend and reference this textbook regularly. You are building a full-stack application to show to the world and prove to employers you are worth the salary you hope to gain.

Use the time between classes to complete your backend so when you have the front-end skills you can easily connect them and host a fully functioning, impressive web app to show to your friends, family, and employers.
