# Class 1: Todo App

<!-- ! HIDE FROM STUDENT; INSTRUCTOR ONLY CONTENT -->
<!-- ## Instructor Only Content - HIDE FROM STUDENTS -->

<!-- Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been teaching for years, here is your first Tip for Teaching.

You’re a developer, you know how this stuff works, that’s not what you have to stress over. Instead, focus your attention on how the class will flow from beginning to end. What do the students do when they come in? How do you introduce yourself? How do you get them to introduce themselves? What’s the next step? And then? And then? How does the end of class look?

Use the textbook to prepare for class. Each lesson is laid out for you to open, conduct, and close class. Bring you’re style and flair to it but don’t re-create the wheel. After all, the students can see the textbook as well...

Once you’ve understood the flow of the class lesson ahead of you, write yourself an outline in a markdown file, pen & paper, or even on the whiteboard. Once you have this, breathe. You got this!

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

As usual, it is incredibly important that you read the pre-homework. If you haven't read the pre-homework and worked through the code-along video YOU WILL BE FAR BEHIND TODAY!!!
 
In the pre-homework, you should have downloaded create-react-app and spun up a create-react-app, built a button that changes state from true to false and then displayed the change of state. Today, we're going to continue that process and build a todo app with React!!


[Example Simple React Todo App](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/)

1. Create a new react app:

    - [ ] `npx create-react-app my-app-name-here`
    - [ ] `cd my-app-name-here`
    - [ ] `git init` and create a new repe
    - [ ] `push` it to the new repo in GitHub
    - [ ] `git remote add origin "https://github.com/your_github_username/$repo_name.git"`

2. Yank out all the unnecessary code and begin building your todo app

    - [ ] Create the `state` for your `app.js` the equal an object with the values: `{isClicked: false, todos: [], text: ''}` in it
    - [ ] Create a button and add an `onClickHandler` that uses `this.setState({})` to change the value of `isClicked` from `false` to `true` and `true` to `false`
    - [ ] Create an input field and an `onChangeHandler` function that changes the state of text: '' to the `e.target.value` `onChange` of the input field
    - [ ] Change your `onClickHandler` function to uses `this.setState({})` to set the value of text as the last value `todos: []`
    
    > Don't forget to spread the rest/`...` of the `todos`

    - [ ] Now clear `text` in the same function
    - [ ] Once you have `state` being changed properly create an element that can be used for each of the items in `todos: []`
    - [ ] Now `.map()` over todos and show each item in the DOM.
        
    > REMEMBER to give the callback function in `.map()` an index and provide that to each of the elements as a prop: key={index}

3. Create a button on each of the item elements and uses `this` and when clicked removes/deletes the item from `todos: []`

    - [ ]  **METHOD 1**: Passing Methods/Functions as Props. Use the following mix-and-match options to pass a delete method that uses `this.setState` to update `state` when the delete button is clicked, passing the `index` of the item back up to the component that handles `state`.

        | ref | Mix & Match Code Snippets |
        | - | - |
        | a | `handleClick={index => this.deleteItem(index)}` |
        | b | `delete = (index) => { ` |
        | c | `}` |
        | d | `let objectCopy = [...this.state.item]` |
        | e | `ObjectCopy.splice(index, 1)` |
        | f | `this.SetState({items: [...objectCopy]})` |
        | g | `<button onClick={() => props.handleClick(index)}>Delete</button>` |

    - [ ] Follow-up Video: [Vimeo, Clayton@ACA - Intro to React, 80 mins](https://vimeo.com/298214155)

    - [ ] Or use **METHOD 2**: use `setState` Hook - [https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-remove-item-from-list](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-remove-item-from-list)

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Create a button that allows you to edit each todo
- [ ] [Add](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/reactjs-implement-drag-and-drop-feature-without-using-external-libraries-ad8994429f1a) a [drag and drop](https://react.rocks/tag/Drag_Drop) feature to reorder the todos
- [ ] Complete both methods of the delete and add functionality

## SETTING EXPECTATIONS

Setting expectations may be the most fundamental practice an instructor can do for their students. By setting expectations of when assignments are due, how the student is expected to study, how the student is expected to participate in class, and what they are expected to learn, students will feel safe and secure because they have a leader that has set the boundaries for their learning experience.

This may seem dogmatic or even militaristic but, in truth, you are the leader of the class. You are the one with the knowledge and they will default to you and trust in you because you have the knowledge. Don’t assume because the students paid their money and are “adults” that they will just create a perfect learning environment that is conducive to all learners and their learning styles. No, you must be the leader. When you commit to taking on the role of leader you can set the stage for expectations and success for all of your students, not just the few that speak out.

## How to Set Expectations

Do it from the beginning. There is a natural flow that happens with all classes: the uneasy introductions phase, the slow to mingle phase, the confident/chaotic cacophony phase (you chose), to the bittersweet farewell phase. The group will evolve but you as the instructor can set the stage for positive evolution or negative evolution. By setting expectations from the beginning and upholding them throughout the course you will create a positive learning environment for positive group evolution and maximum student learning.

- [ ] Due on Sunday
 
 > There will be many assignments to turn in. By setting the due date for all assignments on the following Sunday they won’t miss a due date and not ask you about it either.

- [ ] Student-Focused & Student-Owned Learning.

  > You know as well as anyone that this technology constantly changes; your students must learn to learn on their own! If they don’t, they will not be successful in this field. This doesn’t mean you won’t be helping them along the way but it doesn’t mean you will try to “make up” for their lack of time spent in pre-class lessons. Teach your students that they must take the responsibility to read their textbook, reference documentation, complete practice problems, and watch the videos before they come into class.

- [ ] Follow-up.

  > Out of fear, students like to “suffer in silence” (struggle beyond a reasonable amount of time without asking for help). When they’re silent and look worried ask them:

    * [ ] What are the objectives of this project? Where is your code plan? 

    * [ ] What are you struggling with? What are you trying to accomplish?

    * [ ] Walk me through this app from the entry point to as far as you’ve made. -->

Today you will work with a team of 2-3 junior developers to build a Hackernews Client. For this Hackathon you will need to look at your available data and plan how you want to render it, then plan with your team how to build it. Work smart, not hard.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/492160010?color=2565EF&byline=0&portrait=0" width="655" height="368" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here’s the regular Hacker News site, and then there’s the [Algolia Hacker News Search](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=last24h&page=0&prefix=false&query=&sort=byDate&type=story). If you haven't visited either one, you should start bringing it into your daily practice.

It has been said that all web apps are basically just lists. This app will give you some practice with lists of components that are a little more complicated than todos.

Fetch stories from the [Algolia HN Search REST API](https://hn.algolia.com/api). Hint: Look under the Search heading.

### Instructions

- [ ] [Example NewsFeed](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story)

In groups of 2 - 3:

- [ ] Use your browser to see what the data looks like when you fetch it.
- [ ] Whiteboard and make a plan of the app you want to build with the data.
- [ ] Create a react app, git init and push it to a new repo, then git clone.
- [ ] Together, build a new app people can use!!
- [ ] Specs:

    * [ ] Starts with empty list
    * [ ] Has search bar at the top to filter search for terms
    * [ ] Accepts a search term and calls the HN API with that term as the query
    * [ ] Loads the list
    * [ ] Has a form input to search by date and author

- [ ] Follow-up: [Blog, Medium - How to Build a Simple Hackernews Feed](https://medium.com/styled-components/how-to-build-a-simple-hackernews-feed-with-styled-components-a8905211e45e)

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Add a "View Later" button to flag articles you want to read later. This will move the article into another list.
- [ ] Add a "Not Interested" section to flag articles you don't want to read and greys out the title text when clicked.
- [ ] Add functionality that only displays 10 articles at a time.

<!-- 
Optional Project Two

Make a simplified version of GitHub’s Issues page. Keep the scope small, just focus on implementing the list of issues, and ignore the stuff in the header (search, filtering, stars, etc).

Use the [GitHub Issues API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/)

Example of [GitHub Issues Tracker](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues)
Project 2 Instructions
In groups of 2 - 3:

- [ ] Use your browser to see what the data looks like when you fetch it.
- [ ] Whiteboard and make a plan of the app you want to build with the data.
- [ ] Create a React app, git init and push it to a new repo, then git clone.
- [ ] together, build a new app people can use!!
- [ ] Specs:
    * [ ] Has a form that:
    * [ ] Can filter by repo
    * [ ] Can filter by user.login
    * [ ] Can filter by state
    * [ ] Can filter by title 
 - [ ] Follow Up [Blog, GitHub - Issues Viewer](https://github.com/dceddia/github-issues-viewer)   
    
#### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Add functionality that only allows you to see 10 issues at a time.

 # Class 5: Music App - Part 1 of 2

<!-- ! HIDE FROM STUDENT; INSTRUCTOR ONLY CONTENT -->
<!-- ## Instructor Only Content - HIDE FROM STUDENTS -->
<!-- ## BUILD CONFIDENCE!
 
You may not know it now, but confidence is by far the most important concept you will teach. It doesn’t matter if your students never remember the syntax to link a CSS file to an HTML file, if they come out of your class more confident than they came in you will have served them well! With confidence, students will be able to step into their application from the entry point to final return statement and work through any bug along the way. 

*Solve a bug for a student and they’ll code for a day. Teach them how to debug and they’ll code for life.*

 
- [ ] Set them up for success. Don’t challenge them too much at the beginning. They have plenty of time to learn everything you know and more, but when they’re just starting out you have to give them smaller challenges that build confidence so that they’re ready for the next challenge to conquer and go again for the next, and the next.

- [ ] Socratic Method. Encourage your students’ confidence growth by answering their questions with another question that provokes them to problem-solve. Give the clues that will lead them to realize the solution in their own mind. 

- [ ] Congratulate them! When they do find the solution you can congratulate them & give them a high-five! This emotional transfer acts like glue to set firmly the confidence gained in finding the solution.

- [ ] Use building blocks. When the students are met with a new challenge they don’t understand, think back to previous challenges that are similar or are a part of the new challenge. Use these pieces to build an understanding in the students so that you can light a path toward the solution rather than show them the solution.

In summary, our students must learn so much in such a short amount of time that the best education we can offer them is to learn how to think critically rather than to memorize syntax and aimlessly poke around at code. Teach them to program and they’ll eat for life. -->

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

This week we will build our first application from scratch. It will be a music app with a few simple operations. During this process we will make use of **state**, **props**, **lifecycle methods**, **forms** and **styling with Material UI** to create a login screen and dashboard that interacts with user controls.

You will have both class days this week to complete the project and upload your GitHub URL to the assignment submission. Keep in mind that with this project, the goal is to use our existing knowledge of React to build something that looks very similar to the example images below. Unlike some homework assignments where the exact steps are laid out, this project is intentionally vague in some places. It's to get you to learn how to look up things and implement the right resources. That being said, hints will be given in various sections. Do your best and have fun!

=== "Example One"

    ![music-app-example-one](./../images/music-app-example-one.png)

=== "Example Two"

    ![music-app-example-two](./../images/music-app-example-two.png)

### Project Instructions

#### Setup

- [ ] We will be working from scratch so you will need to create your own GitHub repository for this project and call it `JS411-my-music-app`. Do that now.

#### Project Work

##### 1. Initializing

- [ ] Navigate to a directory of your choosing (wherever you want your project to be) and run the command `npx create-react-app my-music-app`.

- [ ] A new folder called `my-music-app` should have been created.

- [ ] Once your project(`my-music-app`) is created (with npx create-react-app using your terminal) you can navigate to that directory and run the commands `git init` and `git remote add origin <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>` to connect your local application to your remote repository.

- [ ] Now run `npm start` to see the default `create-react-app` code running.

- [ ] Additionally, install Material UI in this folder: [`npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material).

##### 2. Login Screen

Next, you will want to get rid of the default contents inside of App.js of create-react-app and replace them with the login screen. From the examples, the first thing you are probably noticing is the navigation bar.

  > HINT: You can find the [App Bar Component](https://material-ui.com/components/app-bar/) on the Material UI page. There are examples for integrating it.

You will also want the `Button` and `TextField` components from Material UI. Search the site to find examples of those. If you want to add additional styling to these components, simply add the CSS to the App.css file for now. You can add a className on Material UI components just like you can with any other component.

  > HINT: Add a property called `loggedIn` to your `state` that has a Boolean value. It should be set to `false` as the default. When you click the button to login, set that variable to `true`. You will probably want to do some conditional rendering here to show the login screen if the user is not logged in or show something else otherwise. As a refresher...conditional rendering with a ternary operator looks like this:

=== "a Ternary Example"

    ```javascript
      render() {
        return this.state.loggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : (
          // the code for your login screen
        )
      }
    ```

=== "a Regular If/Else Example"

    ```javascript
      render() {
        if (this.state.loggedIn) {
          return <Dashboard />
        } else {
          return (
            // the code for your login screen
          )
        }
      }
    ```

As a final note for the login session, you can make both the username and password fields required but don't worry about any other validation here. You can put whatever you want in those fields, click 'login' and it will work. We can learn more about true authentication in later weeks.

##### 3. Components Folder

Make a folder called `components/` inside your `src/` folder to hold any other components you wish to make in the future. You will need at least one more for the dashboard page.

##### 4. Dashboard Component

Make a component called `Dashboard.js` inside the `components/` folder. You will want to create this component and then import it back into `App.js` to be conditionally rendered based on `login` like in the examples above. For now feel free to render something simple in this component like `<p>testing</p>` to see if it's working.

  > HINT: If you noticed that you lost the nav bar when you navigated to this component then it makes sense because it was probably hardcoded in the App.js file. Find a way to break it out into its own component (maybe NavBar.js) and wrap App component with it so that it always shows up.

Inside `Dashboard.js` you will want to create three cards; the `Card` component, as well as, its accompanying `CardContent` and `CardActions` can be found by looking in [Material UI docs](https://material-ui.com/components/cards/).

  > HINT: You might choose to use `flexbox` (or `grid`) to evenly space these three cards across the dashboard.

##### 5. Card 1 - Online Mode

This card will need access to the [Switch Component](https://material-ui.com/components/switches/). Think about setting a variable in state called `online` and having it be a Boolean value to represent the online status. When the switch is clicked, make sure the state gets updated: `false` to `true`.

##### 6. Card 2 - Master Volume

This card will need access to the [Slider Component](https://material-ui.com/components/slider/). Think about setting a variable in state called `volume` and having it be a number like `20`. When the slider is changed, update the state with the correct volume.

  > HINT: Set your volume on a scale of `0` to `100` with steps of `10` at a time.

##### 7. Card 3 - Sound Quality

This card will need access to the [Select Component](https://material-ui.com/components/selects/). Think about setting a variable in state called "quality" and having it be a number of 1, 2 or 3, representing "Low", "Normal" or "High" quality. When the select box is changed make sure the state gets updated.

##### 8. System Notifications

Create a state variable in the Dashboard component called `notifications` and make it an empty array. When any other piece of state changes (`online`, `volume`, `quality`) update the notifications array with the corresponding messages. Here are the rules to follow:

  - [ ] If the online status is "false" add the message `Your application is offline. You won't be able to share or stream music to other devices.`
  - [ ] If the volume exceeds 80, add the message `Listening to music at a high volume could cause long-term hearing loss.`
  - [ ] If the sound quality is changed to low, add the message `Music quality is degraded. Increase quality if your connection allows it.`

  > HINT: Consider using the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method so that you know whenever the component state has changed. You can access the previous state with the prevState variable. More information on this: [React `componentDidUpdate()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate).

Make sure to map through these notifications and display them underneath a "System Notifications" heading.

> Remember: you also have next class to work on this. Start reading the next pre-homework to understand more about lifecycle methods.

<!-- 

## KNOW YOUR STUDENT. KNOW THE CONTEXT.

Learning doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s progressively built on top of fundamental understandings over time and with effort. It can also be crafted to plan for future understandings. It’s all about context.

Obviously, your students will know more on Day 10 than they know on day 1 but the fact remains they still have a context for what they’re learning on Day 1. That context may be Object-Oriented Design or it may only be knowing how to search on Google, either way when you know their previous understandings you can relate it to what they’re currently learning and build upon their current knowledge.

In the beginning, relating programming concepts to your students can be challenging but a surefire way not to relate to their current understanding is to not ask them what they know. Learning about what their past careers are, what their hobbies are, their previous experiences, and what they know about programming so far will give you tools to use to help them understand the lesson.

- [ ] Get to Know Your Students

- [ ] Follow the Icebreaker Activity on Day 1 of 101

- [ ] Bring in a new “Meet & Greet” activity

- [ ] Read their blogs!

- [ ] Pay attention to their presentations

- [ ] Talk with your students before and after class. -->

Today we are going to practice what we learned last night about React Router. Below are some screenshots of a simple website for cars. We will finish this website by:

- [ ] adding routing with React Router,
- [ ] building a component for the cars detail page,
- [ ] and finally routing to the new component.

Take a look at the images below and notice the URLs in them. Apparently our web designers want these specific URLs for these components.

### Follow-Up

Two things before you watch this video:

1. This guy is writing the component and container is the same file. He explains it. We aren't following that pattern you might see code organized this way in the future.
2. We don't need `bindActionCreators`. You'll see him import it.

Follow the directions in the `README` to complete the project and upload the link to your GitHub repository to Zollege. The project directions are also summed up below:

#### Getting Familiar with the Source Code (DON'T SKIP THIS)

We're continuing to make make the Cars App more robust. This time we've added a pie chart, total, and the ability to add and remove cars. Take a minute to go through the following files (under the components folder):

* `Dashboard.js`
* `Chart.js`
* `Total.js`
* `AddCar.js`

Also, make sure to run the app and go to the dashboard page to see these components in action. Keep in mind, there are things that aren't connected yet. That's what you've been hired to do!

### Project Work

- [ ] The first thing we need to do is create an `actions.js` file inside the `redux/` folder.

#### `addCar`

- [ ] Now, let's create an action creator called `addCar` that takes one parameter called `car`. Have it return an object who's type is `ADD_CAR` and its `value:` is the `car` parameter.

- [ ] Now we need to go to our `reducers.js` file and update the `cars` reducer. To start, give it a second parameter called `action`. This will represent whichever `action` is passed in on `dispatch()`. Now it's time to change this function and give it a switch/case statement. You can reference prior material for this but ultimately we want to switch on `action.type`, provide a case for `ADD_CAR` that returns a copy of the `state` array plus the new car (`[ ...state, action.value]`) and has a default case that simply returns the state for the `mapsStateToProps` function to use.

- [ ] We will be dispatching this action from the `AddCar` component so let's go hook that up now. Notice there is a Form that is collecting the Input data. It happens in a dialog box that appears when you click the "Add Car" button on the dashboard page.

- [ ] We need to create a smart container for this "dumb" component so that we can hook it up to Redux action creators. Create a file called `AddCar.js` inside the `containers/` folder.

- [ ] Import the `{ connect }` function at the top of the file like we have in the other containers. Then, import the `AddCar` component from the `components/` folder. We also need to import the actions, so `import { addCar } from the "redux/actions"` file.

- [ ] Now we are going to write a `mapDispatchToProps` function. Remember, it takes one argument called `dispatch` and it returns an Object who's keys are the props you want to pass to the "dumb" component. It makes sense to create a key called `addCar` and we'll set its value to a function that *dispatches* our `addCar` action creator. It looks like this: `(car) => dispatch(addCar(car))`. The `car` on the left will be passed from our component when we call this function during the Form submission. It will then be passed onto the inner `addCar` function.

- [ ] Remember to `connect` this function to the `AddCar` component and `export` it.

    > A little tip this time, since there is no `mapStateToProps` function we need to pass null in its place. This is because the `connect` function expects the **MSTP** functions as the first parameter, ([see the docs](https://redux.js.org/recipes/usage-with-typescript#typing-the-connect-higher-order-component)). So our export will look like this: `export default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(AddCar)`

- [ ] Now we will go to the `Dashboard` component and swap out the import at the top so that it calls the new `AddCar` smart "container" instead of the regular "dumb" component.

- [ ] Finally, go to the `AddCar` component and find the `handleSubmit` function. Pass that payload to our prop function. Basically, call `this.props.addCar(payload)`. Underneath that, call `this.setState({ open: false })` to close the dialog box. The new car should be added to the bottom of the list.

#### removeCar

- [ ] Ok we can add cars to our table but now we need to be able to remove them. There's a delete column on the table with a little "trash can" icon and when we click that we're going to want to remove an item from the list. The first step is adding a new action. *Hopefully we're getting some of this repetition into our heads.*

- [ ] Go to `redux/actions.js` and create a new function called `removeCar`. You can copy/paste (++opt+shift+down++) directly from the `addUser` function, however we want to change the parameter from `car` to `index` in both places. Also, (this may seem like a given) change the type to "REMOVE_CAR".

    > Why are we changing `car` to `index`? Because it's an easy way to remove an item from an array. If we know it's `index`, we can splice it. So this time we are going to pass an `index` value to the `removeCar` prop.

- [ ] Once that's done it's time to update our reducer again. Go to `redux/reducers.js` and make another case statement for `REMOVE_CAR`. In this one, create a copy of the state (`newState`) and then `.splice()` the `index` out of it. Finally, `return` the `newState`. 

    > If you forget, the "splice" function takes a starting index and a number of items to delete as its parameters so it will look like this: `splice(action.value, 1)` where `action.value` is the `index` we are passing.

- [ ] Ok, since the button we want to tie this to is in the `Dashboard` component and it already has a container . . . we don't need to create a new one. We do, however, need to go to `containers/Dashboard.js` and add the `mapDispatchToProps` function though. Do that right below that `mapStateToProps` one. This function should return an object with a key of `removeCar` and a value of `(index) => dispatch(removeCar(index))`. Also, don't forget to import that `{ removeCar }` action at the top of the file. We also need to ensure that we pass the `mapDispatchToProps` function to `connect`.

- [ ] Now that everything is hooked up we need to use our new action. In the `Dashboard.js` component, create an `onClick` method on the Icon (the last TableCell) that is a function. It should call `props.removeCar` with the `index` as the argument. The current `index` can be found in the beginning of the `map` function. Its value is `idx`.

- [ ] When you click the trash can icon the corresponding row should be removed. Is it working? If not, ask the your classmates to look over the code with you.

#### Pie Chart & Total

- [ ] Now that we have that working we are going to practice what we learned last class and add containers and `mapStateToProps` functions for the Chart and Total components. Why? Because we want these to always have the current `cars` information. We'll see how this is useful in a second.

- [ ] Create a file called `Total.js` underneath the "containers" folder and create a `mapStateToProps` function. You can use the `Car.js` file as an example and simply change the component from `Car` to `Total`.

- [ ] Next, go to the `Dashboard` COMPONENT and change the `import` for `Total` to reference the container instead of the component. Ex. `import Total from '../containers/Total'`

- [ ] Finally, go to the `Total.js` file under the components folder and change the number `4` to `{props.cars.length}`. The total should now display "20".

- [ ] Go ahead and add and remove items from the table. Notice the total update in real time. This is something that wouldn't have been possible with normal React state because the information for `Total` lives in a different component. Components are meant to be re-usable so if we ever wanted to put this `Total` somewhere else in our application we could just import it and use it like in `Dashboard` and it will always have the correct cars data.

- [ ] Now we need to do the same thing for the `Chart` component. Create a file called `Chart.js` under containers and hook up the `mapStateToProps` function so that it has access to the `cars` prop. You can copy from `Total` and change the component names.

- [ ] Once again in `Dashboard` component, change the `Chart` `import` so that it points to the container.

- [ ] Finally, in `components/Chart.js` above the return statement, create two variables called `over` and `under`. Use the `filter` method to filter the `props.cars` for `car`s whose horsepower match the criteria. Then use those values in the corresponding Pie Chart. They will be `over.length` and `under.length`.

- [ ] You should see 4 (in red) over 200 and 16 (in orange) under 200. But wait . . . since this data is connected to Redux it will change according to our actions. So go ahead and delete 3 cars whose horsepower is under 200. Did you see the chart change? Again, since Dashboard, Chart and Total are all referencing the same data . . . they will always be in sync. The addition of the Pie Chart will always equal the total.

- [ ] One more thing, when you remove a car from the list you can also go to the homepage and notice that its card has also been removed. Pretty cool, huh? It's all tied together.

Today we are going to create a mock-import utility that we can use in our cars application. We will use Redux Thunk to hit an API that brings back cars data. We will then allow the user to delete each import. We also want to keep a current count of the imported cars. Some images below will show what the webpage should look like.

### Examples

=== "One"

### Project Instructions

- [ ] Fork and clone the [Redux-Thunk Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/411_wk6_day1_redux_thunk)

- [ ] Follow the directions in the `README.md` to complete the project. The project directions are also summed up below:

A lot of the Material UI documentation has been updated to support the new React feature called Hooks. We will not dive deep into the topic in this class but watch this video to understand what's going on because you likely ran across some documentation regarding hooks while building out your table for the import page, and as you move forward in your new career you will **very** likely see hooks.

- [ ] Follow-Up Video: [YT, TraversyMedia - React Hooks Intro](https://youtu.be/mxK8b99iJTg)

### Push Yourself Further

When you've finished the project for this class you'll notice that the table is very long and you have to scroll for a bit before you get to the bottom of it. Imagine if it were 2 or 3 times that size. Imagine if there were 1000 rows. This provides a bad user experience. Reference the documentation from Material UI below and see if you can add pagination to the import table.

While you might not code much today it is not a simple, boring, or *free* day. You should use the time you have today with your teammates and instructor to plan out your Capstone Project App. Today is a day for you to think more about the frontend of your Capstone App. You should already have some ideas and preferably something started but if you don't, please do that today.

There are no examples, project instructions or follow-up in today's lesson. Just use this time wisely and ask the instructor if you have any questions on the implementation of your project.

With your teammate:

- [ ] **List out the core functions of your Capstone App**
- [ ] **Compare lists and trim out unnecessary functions**
- [ ] **Agree upon the core functions together.**
- [ ] **Next, draw out the look of your app. What components will you need?**
- [ ] **Build a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/) for both of you to thoughtfully build your app**
- [ ] **Begin adding to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/) the steps you KNOW you have to do.**
- [ ] **YOU SHOULD NOT BE CODING YET.**

Here are few quotes to inspire your work today:

* *A computer program does what you tell it to do, not what you want it to do.*
* *First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. —John Johnson*
* *Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. —Bill Gates*
* *When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code. —Richard Pattis*
* *Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty "text" file. —Louis Srygley*
and finally...

* *Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.*

### Project Instructions

- [ ] 30 minutes in pairs, writing and drawing system requirements for each student's app.
- [ ] 30 minutes of volunteers at the board working with the instructor to design and plan their app.
- [ ] Rest of class dedicated to students back in pairs writing and drawing their plans together.
- [ ] Go to the blank sign-in component that's connected to your 311 Server and make a new branch called `CapstonePlanning`. Be sure you're only using one repo and not both of your teammates' repos!
- [ ] Take pictures of your drawings and add them to a folder in that repo called planningImages
- [ ] Next add the list Core Functions to a `README.md` file. Turn in the pull request as your CapstonePlanning assignment for today.

Today is a very BIG day! Please come in prepared and ready to hit the ground running.

We'll spend 30 minutes after Whiteboarding and Discussion to plan our Capstone Project with your teammates then we'll move on to discussion, planning, and the building of your [Checkpoint 2 Project](./checkpointTwo-smallBizApp.md).

### Instructions

#### Part 1 Instructions

In your pre-class lesson, you read about the importance of your back-end providing the data your front-end needs to share with users. Get with your partner now and:

- [ ] Take a look at the core functions of your app.
- [ ] Look at the routes and database your server from 311 currently have.
- [ ] What needs to be added?
- [ ] What needs to be changed?
- [ ] Write it out, plan it into tasks, and add it to your Trello board.
- [ ] Bring out the drawings you did last night. Compare and consider.
- [ ] Do you two have the same vision? Are you able to agree?
- [ ] Make re-drawings and plan together what it will look like. Consider too that you've been using Material UI. Should you use the components offered with it?
- [ ] Take pictures of your drawings and add them to your blank sign-in repo in a folder called: `planningImages`
- [ ] List anything important and link your Trello board to your `README.md` file so you have a place to gather all of your needed materials.

#### Part 2 Instructions

Now that you've got some plans laid out for your Capstone app let's look at your [Checkpoint 2 Project](./checkpointTwo-smallBizApp.md). All of the information and instruction you'll need is on that page.

> Remember, you also have the next class to work on the checkpoint. Spend time researching any material you feel uncomfortable with.

- [ ] Compare your Google Drawings to your teammate's and decide what tweaks need to be made.
- [ ] Agree upon one diagram that clearly represents your app.
- [ ] Take the flow to another group and ask them to walk through it for themselves without your help. Did it make sense to them?
- [ ] Repeat the last step.
- [ ] What tasks are on your Trello board that you think you can start doing today? Finish today?
- [ ] Go do it. Try to time box your tasks. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see what you can get done in that time.
- [ ] When the timer goes off, stand up, stretch, walk around, breathe, count to 30, then return.
- [ ] Rinse and repeat.

Continue working on the Small Business App from last class. If you finish this exercise early, help a friend! Again, one of the best ways to learn is to teach. You will need to have this assignment submitted in Zollege by this weekend.
