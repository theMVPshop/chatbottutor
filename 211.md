# Class 1: JavaScript Review

*The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. —Walt Disney*

## Greet, Outline, and Objectify

Since we don't know each other, at least, not your instructor, everyone should answer these questions aloud:

1. Hi, my name is ...
2. I currently work as a ... but I love to spend my time ...
3. I'm excited about learning to program because ...
4. My best time to do a study group or tutoring is ... (example: Mondays in the afternoon.)

### Daily Student Presentations Overview & Organization

While learning to code is pretty important if you want to code for work, so is learning to talk about code! To do this, you must first know something about code. Secondly, you have to know something about talking to people in one-on-one chats, group conversations and team presentations. This is a necessary skill and will be a major part of your future interviews. To get us all prepped and ready to talk about our code, we're going to be practicing talking to the class about shortcuts and tool efficiency. It's one thing to know how to code and it's another to know how to use your computer's keyboard, text editor and terminal well. Wow your interviewers with your sharp fingers and grow your class's skill with these presentations! Today we will assign people to the remaining days of class to present for 5-7 minutes ONLY, at the beginning of class, on the pre-assigned topic.

[All student presentation topics are listed here](./../additionalResources/studentPresentations.md). Take the time now to select, plan, and record what day you're presenting. Next class one-third of the class will give a four-minute pitch of their planned Capstone App they intend to build by the end of 411.

**Prompt**

  > Pitch your Capstone App to the class. What’s the problem? How does this app solve it?

Through the next week the other two-thirds of the class will follow suit and present a four-minute pitch over their Capstone App!!

[Questions to prompt discussion](./../additionalResources/questionsForDiscussion/qfd-class-1.md)

## Creation Time, 60-90 minutes

1. Let's take a look at the [JS211-CurrentDate Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS211_CurrentDateTimeProject.git)

- [ ]  Did anyone not finish it?
- [ ]  Let's walk through it one by one starting from the `package.json` file.
- [ ]  Did anyone not get it pushed up to their gitHub account?

2. Use your knowledge of HTML and CSS to bring the functionality of these code blocks to the DOM

- [ ]  Go to the index.html file and see how the file is connected to main.js.
- [ ]  Follow the pattern to bring your JavaScript solutions to the DOM for a user to see visually.
- [ ]  `git status`
- [ ]  `git add main.js index.html`
- [ ]  `git status`
- [ ]  `git commit -m "Solutions are fixed and showing in the DOM"`
- [ ]  `git push`

<!-- ! HIDDEN CONTENT: INSTRUCTOR ONLY -->

- [ ] Restate the question aloud.
- [ ] Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard.
- [ ] Ask any clarifying questions you need.
- [ ] Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up.
- [ ] Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard.
- [ ] Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!
- [ ] Build the structure of your function(s).
- [ ] Slowly work through your code plan building the steps you need.

Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud. It's not about finding the solution. It's about collaborating and working toward a solution! After you finish, take a picture and transfer it to a Repl.it when you get home.

## Creation Time, 60-90 minutes

Your first terminal application!! YAY!! Today, you're going to build a function, or two, that will take in an input from a user then another input from another user and compare them against one another to determine the winner of the game!

Fork & Clone the [RPS Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS211_RockPaperScissorsProject.git) then follow the `README.md` file.

- [ ] `User1` input of `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- [ ] `User2` input of `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- [ ] Compare `User1` input to `User2` input.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'rock'` and `User2` input is `'scissors'`, `User1` wins.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'rock'` and `User2` input is `'paper'`, `User2` wins.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'rock'` and `User2` input is `'rock'`, it's a tie.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'paper'` and `User2` input is `'rock'`, `User1` wins.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'paper'` and `User2` input is `'scissors'`, User2 wins.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'paper'` and `User2` input is `'paper'`, it's a tie.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'scissors'` and `User2` input is `'paper'`, User1 wins.
- [ ] If `User1` input is `'scissors'` and `User2` input is `'rock'`, `User2` wins.
- [ ] If `User1` input is '`scissors'` and `User2` input is `'scissors'`, it's a tie.

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] What should the program return if the user inputs something that isn't "rock", "paper", or "scissors"?
- [ ] Can you use `.trim()` to solve the problem if a user types in a space with their input?
- [ ] Minimize redundancy: D.R.Y. up your code. Are their ways to not type as much as you've typed? Can you make the code smaller?
- [ ] Compartmentalize your code into individual functions. This game doesn't have to run just one function. Can you pull code blocks out and put them into other functions that can be called from `rockPaperScissors`?

## Blog, to Show You Know

Every other class will end with a discussion over these questions. If you have no idea about them, ask your instructor. Nevertheless, you will need to research the topics on your own and record what you learned in a blog. You will then turn in a link with the url of the published blog in Zollege. Feel free to copy/paste the question into google and read about what comes up. These interview questions are meant to broaden your knowledge and cover more ground than we can possibly get to in these few weeks. We want you to be well prepared for the rigors of interviewing for development jobs and knowing the answers to these questions will ensure that you have every tool you need to succeed!

From What is [Pig Latin on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin):

> Pig Latin is a language game in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix. For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

```javascript
  toPigLatin("Pig Latin") // => Igpay Atinlay
```

Today you're going to build the logic for this fun little program.

- [ ] [Demo - Pig Latin Translator](https://funtranslations.com/pig-latin)
- [ ] Students will build the Pig Latin application using the [Pig Latin Repo starter code](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS211_PigLatinProject.git).
- [ ] Why do we need to fork?
- [ ] Why do we need to run `npm i`?
- [ ] The basic idea of Pig Latin is to take the first letters of a word up to the first vowel, move them to the end of the word, and add 'ay' to the end of it.

> Below we see a function called pigLatin that gets multiple words passed into it as arguments. The `// --->` represents what the function will return with the given parameter.

```javascript
  pigLatin('car') //=> 'arcay'
  pigLatin('create') //=> 'eatecray'
  pigLatin('pony') //=> 'onypay'
  pigLatin('egg') //=> 'eggyay'
```

Use a whiteboard to plan how Pig Latin works before building it with code.

Today you'll practice array methods, as well as attaching your Tic Tac Toe logic to an index.html file so your user can have a friendlier interaction with your applications moving forward.

### Part 1 of 3: Array of Cars Practice

- [ ] Clone [ArrayOfCars Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS211_ArrayPractice).
- [ ] Go to the `README.md` file and follow the directions

### Part 2 of 3: TTT GUI

Students will build the Tic Tac Toe application again but this time using the logic built in the last class.

- [ ] Begin by whiteboarding and code planning the application.
- [ ] Open your Tic Tac Toe app from last week.
From the `master` branch, create a new branch called: 'TicTacToe-GUI'
- [ ] Use the project you built in Web 101 as a reference, but now build it with the idea of logic first then front-end representation.
- [ ] How do you get your HTML file to talk to your JS file?

<!-- #### HIDDEN CONTENT - Legacy Perhaps 

NOTE TO EDITOR: I hid this from learners because of the very last line, which says  "Check out index.html for an idea . . .", but offers no link or explanation for what that index.html file might be (not even in the Campus Manager version). In the version visible to learners I simply removed the line, but didn't want the reference to disappear forever in case there is an appropriate index.html file that should be linked. Thanks! - Rob Watkins.

- [ ] Add your code to this branch and when you're finished turn in your pull request url.

### Part 2: Git Refresher

Instructor will lead a discussion over Git, branching and merging.

## Blogs to Show You Know

Every other class will end with a discussion over these questions. If you have no idea about them, ask your instructor. Nevertheless, you will need to research the topics on your own and record what you learned in a blog. You will then turn in a link with the url of the published blog in Zollege. Feel free to copy/paste the question into google and read about what comes up. These interview questions are meant to broaden your knowledge and cover more ground than we can possibly get to in these few weeks. We want you to be well prepared for the rigors of interviewing for development jobs and knowing the answers to these questions will ensure that you have every tool you need to succeed!

### Pt. 1 - .forEach() from Scratch

When working with the many built-in methods of JavaScript or any language, it's important to know how they work internally so you are not constrained by their usage or unaware of their "gotchyas". Create a Repl.it and turn in the URL of it.

### Pt. 3 - MasterMind

[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game%29)) is a code-breaking game, where a player tries to guess the code based on a limited amount of information given from an incorrect guess. You can [play the game here](http://www.web-games-online.com/mastermind/).

#### MasterMind App Specs

- [ ] Create a new branch called "masterMind"
- [ ] **Spec 0 - Define a test solution**: Helpful suggestion: while developing you can set a default solution for you to test against. At the top of `mastermind()`, simply set const `solution = 'abcd';` as a global variable.
- [ ] **Spec 1 - Detect a correct solution**: In `mastermind()`, if the guess you passed in equals the `solution`, return `'You guessed it!';`
Spec 2 - Generate a hint: `generateHint()` should take one argument, guess.
- [ ] **Spec 2.1 - Split up the solution and guess**: In `generateHint()`, create variables `solutionArray` and `guessArray` that each split up passed in arguments, [.split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/splitting on `''` (empty string).
- [ ] **Spec 2.2 - Determine correct "letter-locations"**: Create a variable `correctLetterLocations` and set it to `0`. This variable will record how many correct "letter-locations" were guessed. For instance, a guess of `aabc` against a solution of `deba` would yield one correct "letter-location" (b). In a `for` loop, iterate over the solutionArray, comparing each index of `solutionArray` against the same index of `guessArray`. If the item matches, increment `correctLetterLocations`, and set that index in `solutionArray` to `null`.
- [ ] **Spec 2.3 - Determine correct "letters"**: Now that we have `null`ed the already counted `correctLetterLocations`, we can see if the `guessArray` contains any `correctLetters` that were not in the correct location. Set a variable `correctLetters` equal to `0`, and in a `for` loop, again iterate over the `solutionArray`. Using .[`indexOf`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf), determine if the item at the current index in `guessArray` appears inside of `solutionArray`. Save that index in a variable called `targetIndex`. Now, `if` `targetIndex` is greater than `-1`(it exists in the array), increment `correctLetters` and set the item in `solutionArray` at that index equal to `null`.
- [ ] **Spec 2.4 - `return` hint string**: Optionally, you can use the [colors package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors), return a string that prints out the hints you generated, with `correctLetterLocations` being red, `correctLetters` being white, and separated by a hyphen.
    > (NOTE: If you choose to use this color package, only `console.log` the result. If you `return` the result your program will fail the tests.)
- [ ] **Spec 3 - Add guess and hint to the board**: Define a variable called hint that collects the returned value of `generateHint(guess)`. `.push` the `guess` and the `hint` (as a combined string) into the board.
- [ ] **Spec 4 - End the game**: After 10 incorrect guesses, if the `board` `length` equals `10`, `return` `'You ran out of turns! The solution was `' and the `solution`. Otherwise, return `'Guess again.'`.

By now you should be fairly familiar with loops; however, you can never get enough practice! Loops are used all the time and you should get used to using them and very comfortable with implementing them.

- [ ] Create a new repo & Clone it
- [ ] Create a branch called `loops` off of `master`.

Complete each of the following exercises:

- [ ] Use a do...while loop to `console.log` the numbers from 1 to 1000.
- [ ] Create an object (with keys and values) called person with the following data:
    - [ ]  `firstName: "Jane",`
    - [ ]  `lastName: "Doe",`
    - [ ]  `birthDate: "Jan 5, 1925",`
    - [ ]  `gender: "female"`
- [ ] Create a function that logs out the keys of the object using `Object.keys()`.
- [ ] Create a function that logs out the keys and values of the object using `Object.entries()`.
- [ ] Create an `arrayOfPersons` that contains multiple "people" objects. You can simply copy/paste the person object you made above multiple times. Feel free to change the values to reflect multiple people you might have in your database.
- [ ] Create a function that uses a for...of loop and an if statement to `console.log `the value associated with the key birthDate of each object if the birth year is an odd number.
- [ ] Use `.map()` to map over the `arrayOfPersons` and `console.log()` their information.
- [ ] Use `.filter()` to filter the persons array and `console.log` 0only males in the array.
- [ ] Create a function that returns true if the value of `birthDate` is before Jan 1, 1990.
- [ ] Use `.filter()` to filter the `persons` array and `console.log` only people that were born before Jan 1, 1990.
- [ ] **BONUS** - Create a function that returns true if the date passed to it is `>= 21` years in the past.
- [ ] **BONUS** - `.filter()` out the people in the array who are younger than 21.

### Push Yourself Further

When searching for specific data, [regular expression or RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is a useful tool to know how to use. Paired with the methods you've been practicing lately, you will be a JavaScript ninja in no time.

We're only going to introduce RegEx briefly. It's a subject for you to truly learn only on your own. This is by no means a requirement to pass this course or to graduate. But eventually you will want to know and use RegEx professionally. Do yourself a favor and add [reading and practicing RegEx](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to your daily exercises.

```javascript
  var re = /p+l/;
  const re = new RegEx('p+l')

  // the two expressions above both match the 'ppl' in 'apple' and the 'pl' in 'people'
  // the '+' looks for one or as many instances of the character that precedes it. In this case it's 'p'.
```

Today students will apply their knowledge of object-oriented programming to create two classes: one that can be used to represent a bank account and another to represent the transactions the bank account holds.

**BankAccount class** - This class represents a bank account.

1. The class should have the following fields:
    - [ ] `accountNumber` - String representing the account number
    - [ ] `owner` - String representing the owner of the account
    - [ ] `transactions` - An array of transactions representing the history of all transactions associated with this account

2. The constructor should take in the following input:
    - [ ] `accountNumber` - The account Number
    - [ ] `owner` - The name of the person who owns this account

      > NOTE: When an account is created, you should initialize the transactions array to be an empty array

3. The class should have the following 3 methods:
    - [ ] `balance()` - This method does not take any input, and returns the current balance on the account. The balance is computed by summing up the amounts in the transactions array.
    - [ ] `deposit(amt)` - This method takes in a single input, the deposit amount. This method should create a new transaction representing the deposit, and add it to the transactions array.

      > NOTE: You should not be able to deposit a negative amount

    - [ ] `charge(payee, amt)` - This method takes in the payee and amount, creates a new transaction with the payee and amount, and adds the transaction to the transaction array.

      > NOTE: You should not be able to charge an amount that would make your balance dip below 0

**Transaction class** - This class represents a single transaction in a bank account.

1. The class should have the following fields:
    - [ ] `date` - The date of the transaction
    - [ ] `amount` - The amount of the transaction. Positive amounts are money going into the account (deposit, refund). Negative amounts are money coming out of the account (a charge or debit).
    - [ ] `payee` - The description or payee on the transaction

2. The constructor should take in the following input:
    - [ ] `amount` - The amount on the transaction
    - [ ] `payee` - The payee or description on the transaction

    > NOTE: The `date` is not passed into the constructor. The constructor should set the date to be the current date automatically.

### Push Yourself Further

#### **SavingsAccount class** - This class should extend the BankAccount class.

1. The class should have an additional field:
    - [ ] `interestRate` - This value represents the rate at which the account earns interest

1. The constructor should take the following as input:
    - [ ] `accountNumber` - See BankAccount class
    - [ ] `owner` - See `BankAccount` class
    - [ ] `interestRate` - The rate that is used to compute interest

1. Additional methods:
    - [ ] `accrueInterest()` - This method should use the `balance()` to get the current balance and add a new transaction representing a deposit of the appropriate amount.

#### Checkers

### Part 1: Git and BankAccount Review

Instructor led discussion over Git and BankAccount

### Part 2: Functional Programming Rebuild

By now you should very much know how to build higher-order functions from scratch. Today you will warm-up on the more important and useful higher order functions: `.map()`, `.reduce()` and `.filter()`.

- [ ] Whiteboard, make a code plan and build each of the following methods:
    - [ ]  `.map()` - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with each item manipulated by that function.
    - [ ]  `.reduce()` - function that takes an array of food orders with their amounts and returns the total amount of all the food orders.
    - [ ]  `.filter()` - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with only the items that return true in the function.
- [ ] Create a repo called "Higher-Order-From-Scratch".
- [ ] Practice working from branches by creating a new branch called: "HigherOrder".
- [ ] Place your code in a file called `main.js`.
- [ ] Create a pull request (PR) for `Higher-Order-From-Scratch` to be merged into `master`.

Using the algorithms you've been learning about so far you will join forces with a group of 3 total students and choose one of the following prompts to build a solution for the challenge. Work as a team, divide the work, share a repo and get a working prototype up by the end of class.

### Prompt 1: Hang Man

**Project Objective** - This is a terminal based app. Reveal a letter from a word if a user inputs that letter and it exists in the word. If it doesn't let the user know.

=== "Example"

    ```console
      Input: Any letter
      _ _ _ _ _

      L (input)
      _ _ L L _ (return)

      H (input)

      H _ L L _

      E (input)

      H E L L _

      O (input)

      H E L L O
    ```

=== "Instructions"

    ```markdown
      1. First build this project in the terminal
      2. Then attach it to the DOM
      3. Work through the challenge together
      4. As always whiteboard it and make a code plan
      5. Translate from English to pseudo code then to JavaScript
      6. Test
      7. Present to class
      8. Turn in the URL to your repo, once for each person in your group
    ```

=== "Push Yourself Further"

    ```markdown
      Further Practice Challenge - Keep track of the user's lives, so if they guess incorrectly they lose a life.

      Challenge example:

      _ _ _ _ _

      V (input)

      "V" is not in the word! 4 lives left!

      _ _ _ _ _
    ```

### Prompt 2: Ramp Numbers

A ramp number is a number whose digits from left to right either only rise or stay the same. 1234 is a ramp number and so is 1124 and 13569. But 1032 is not and neither is 1528.

Challenge: Given the input of a number, build a program that will find the total number of ramp numbers that are less than it.

Example:

=== "Code Example"

    ```javascript
      const numOfRampsBelow = (num) => {
        //  Your code goes here
      }

      numOfRampsBelow(99999) // => "2001 total ramp numbers are less than 99999"
    ```

=== "Example 2"

    ```markdown
      Given: A positive integer, n.

      Output: The number of total ramp numbers less than n.

      Example input: 123

      Example output: 65 total ramp numbers are less than 123
    ```

=== "Instructions"
    ```markdown
      1. First build this project in the terminal
      2. Then attach it to the DOM
      3. Work through the challenge together
      4. As always whiteboard it and make a code plan
      5. Translate from English to pseudo code then to JavaScript
      6. When you finish work on the Further Practice Challenge
      7. Test
      8. Present to class
      9. Turn in the URL to your repo, once for each person in your group
    ```

=== "Push Yourself Further"
    
    ```markdown
      Further Practice Challenge - Display all of the ramp numbers that are less than the input number (n).
    ```

### Prompt 3: Count It

Given a sentence, paragraph or novel, count the letters in the string. Ignore whitespace and anything not `[a-z][A-Z]`, i.e. punctuations and numbers.

=== "Example"

    ```console
      Given: A string - like "Hello World"

      Output: Letters and how often they show up. - d:1 e:1 h:1 l:3 o:2 r:1 w:1
    ```

=== "Instructions"

    ```markdown
      1. First build this project in the terminal
      2. Then attach it to the DOM
      3. Work through the challenge together
      4. As always whiteboard it and make a code plan
        > Hint: convert all to lowercase first
      5. Translate from English to pseudo code then to JavaScript
      6. Test
      7. Present to class
      8. Turn in the URL to your repo, once for each person in your group
      
      > Use this challenge input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and the sleeping cat early in the day."
    ```

=== "Push Yourself Further"

    ```markdown
      1. Use RegEx
      2. Make a word count
      3. Count each word's appearance
      4. [Calculate the grade level/proficiency of English](https://www.thoughtco.com/calculating-reading-level-1857103) for the sentence, paragraph or novel
    ```

If you worked on the practice problem in the pre-work you should have a firm grasp of an API and how to request data from it. Today we're going to build an address book using a free API as our server of data.

In pairs, create a list of users and display their info:

- [ ] Read these instructions and understand the requirements FIRST
- [ ] Whiteboard your app
- [ ] Make a code plan
- [ ] Pseudo code and then translate to JavaScript
- [ ] Create a new repo (name it descriptively well), clone it to your local machine and share it with your partner
- [ ] Open the directory and create an `index.html` and `main.js` file to fetch a user and display them one at at time
- [ ] Use the API: `https://randomuser.me/api/` to fetch a user now
- [ ] Fetch a new user multiple times and store them in an array
- [ ] Then list out all the users in your address book array by name and picture
- [ ] [Figure out](https://randomuser.me/documentation) how to fetch multiple users in one fetch request
- [ ] Fetch multiple users on window load
- [ ] Add a button to each user that when clicked displays the rest of their information like `DOB`, `address` and so forth
- [ ] Once you have the functionality working, feel free to style and structure your address book with CSS and HTML

**YOU KNOW HOW TO DO ALL OF THIS BY NOW. TRUST YOURSELF!!**

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Display your users alphabetically
- [ ] Add another button to hide the information
- [ ] Request only users from AU, then US, then FR and then GB
- [ ] Figure out how to only request name, picture and cell
- [ ] Figure out how to exclude: dob, registered, nationality, location

- [ ] ABSOLUTELY THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD DO:
    * [ ] Style your address book with some flare by adding a CSS file

We've done a lot of programming by ourselves but rarely do we program in a bubble alone. Most of the time we are usually working with a team. Today you are going to choose an app you want to build, pair up with someone based on your mutual interests, create a repo, clone it to each of your machines, work in separate branches and collaborate to figure out the docs of the API you choose and the layout and style of the app you want to build.

- [ ] Choose an app you want to build
- [ ] Pair up with someone based on your interests
- [ ] Create a repo using your template
- [ ] Clone it to one of your machines
    - [ ]  `npm init`
    - [ ]  Understand [dotenv](https://youtu.be/zDup0I2VGmk)
    - [ ]  `npm install dotenv --save`
    - [ ]  `require('dotenv').config()` at the top of your `main.js`
    - [ ]  create a `.gitignore` file in the root folder
    - [ ]  add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file
    - [ ]  create a `.env` in the root folder and save your API key in it by...
    - [ ]  adding something like `SECRET_KEY=abcd1234` to the `.env` file
- [ ] `git` `add` `commit` `push`...
- [ ] Now clone it to your partner's machine
- [ ] Repeat the .env file process so each of you have a copy of the API key
- [ ] Work in separate branches (be careful of merge conflicts)
- [ ] Focus on functionality first
- [ ] Only style after you have all the functionality working
- [ ] The projects can become a final project if you like. You can continue building them on your own or together. In class, however, we are just going to focus on accessing the API and doing a few simple things with the data we get back.

### Prompts

#### Brewery App

`[https://www.brewerydb.com/developers](https://www.brewerydb.com/developers)`

### Part 1: Testing Your Fetch

Last week you paired up and built an app that fetches data from an API. Today you're going to add unit tests for multiple situations:

- [ ] Mistyped address
- [ ] Out of range request
- [ ] Wrong API key
- [ ] *Hypothetical 4*
- [ ] *Hypothetical 5*

#### Instructions

- [ ] Pair up with your partner again
- [ ] `git status` to make sure you each have pushed up and merge all of your changes
- [ ] Work on one computer and add the 5 unit tests mentioned. You will have to refactor your request a bit to add in `fetch` as a dependency

### Part 2: Recursive Exponent

In a Repl.it called Exponent of Number - Recursively

- [ ] Write a recursive JavaScript program to compute the exponent of any number given. 

  > Note: The exponent of a number says how many times the base number is used as a factor.

- [ ] Example: If you were given the number 64: `8 ** 2 = 8 x 8 = 64`. Here `8` is the base and `2` is the exponent.
- [ ] [MDN Docs- Exponentiation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Exponentiation)
- [ ] Turn in the URL.

### Part 3: Recursive Sum of Array

In a new Repl.it called Sum of Array - Recursively

- [ ] Write a recursive JavaScript program to compute the sum of an array of integers.
- [ ] Example : `const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] sumArr(array1) // => Expected Output : 21`
- [ ] Turn in the URL.

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

### Part 1: Lodash

You've used `dotenv` already so you know about Node and npm. Now bring in this npm module and learn to use it. Yes, it will be a little challenging because you've never worked with this module before but often times interviews will go like this. You don't really know the library but they ask you about it, you've probably heard about it and now you're going to figure out how to use it.

- [ ] While pair-programming, create a new repo: "Lodash-Practice".
- [ ] `git clone` the repo.
- [ ] Then use `npm init` to initialize the repo for Node.
- [ ] Hit ++enter++ multiple times to generate an empty and basic package.json.
- [ ] [Install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) lodash.
- [ ] Use this [blog on lodash](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/01/12/common-javascript-functions-with-lodash/) to understand the power.
- [ ] Use the [lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10).
- [ ] Use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfikit351Y) to see how to use lodash.
- [ ] Build a simple terminal app that uses at least 5 lodash methods.
    - [ ]  Use fake data or APIs you have worked with in previous projects or google fake data you can use. - [ ]  Either make a fetch or save it in a few variables.
    - [ ]  Console.log the output of each lodash method called on the fake data.
    - [ ]  Use at least these methods: `_.chunk()`, `_.reverse()`, `_.without()`, `_.shuffle()`.
    - [ ]  Create unit tests with Mocha for each function you build.

  > TIP: use the data from day 11 for arrays and objects to tinker with. Or google fake data.

### Part 2: Recursion, find GCD

In a new Repl.it called: GCD-Recursion

Write a recursive JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers. Example: `findGCD(25, 20) // => 5 findGCD(50, 20) // => 10`

#### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Continue on! After you finish these five, switch roles—navigator is now the driver and the driver is now the navigator.
- [ ] Create 5 more inputs, buttons and displays for 5 more lodash methods.
- [ ] Create unit tests for each of your functions.
